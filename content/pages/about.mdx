---
I’m an engineering leader who has gained expertise in building high-functioning, efficient, and happy teams in organizations that have not yet established a consistent process, have a nascent engineering practice or have simply grown extremely fast and are looking for someone to help streamline operations, improve morale, and advise in the building of products that can stand the test of time.

In my spare time, I live vicariously through my kids, get inspired by my wife, draw on occasion and apply my programming skills to pet projects. I’m obsessed with efficiency in my work-life and my personal life. This characteristic is helpful at work and extremely annoying to those around me at home.
