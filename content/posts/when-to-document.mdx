Organizations leak knowledge - it's the nature of organizations.  A person learn's something through some experience.  They store that knowledge so that the next time something similar happens, they can apply that knowledge to create a new, hopefully better, experience.  The human brain is pretty good at that.  But what about organizations?  In this scenario, person A has had this experience but no one else has the benefit of the gained knowledge.  So when person B runs into the same situation, they effectively have to relearn that knowledge which takes up time that could be better spent  experiencing something that no one else has yet to experience adding to the total organizational knowledge.  I call the loss of this potential knowledge a leak.

But, since we're not the borg, we cannot share all of our experiences all the time.  So some level of inefficiency is both inevitable and expected.
